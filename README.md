# AlgorithmLibrary
A small library of custom useful functions/algorithms/data structures to be copy pasted during competitive programming. The goal is to cover the commonly used c++ standard algorithms and more for Python3. This library is non-exhaustive and for personal use only.

Note that iterable type hinting introduced in the later versions of Python are not supported by most judges, therefore remember to remove them if runtime error occurs. Examples include:
- `vector2` class `neighbours`, `neighbours_eight` methods
- `srange` function
- `BinaryTree` class `preOrder`, `inOrder`, `postOrder` methods

Test data is included within any script in the library, so please comment them out if you wish to copy paste on the spot.

Folders and scripts in `Pending/...` are yet to be sorted, please use them at your own discretion.
